# Cache Simulator

# Goal

Engineering software that can be used to perform the function of a CPUâ€™s cache memory on a computer. 

# Methodology

In this project, I am engineering the principles and structure of cache memory that is found in the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer. The core of engineering the cache memory is building the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm that determines which cache line to evict when the set in the cache memory is full. Other features/principles of Cache memory are inclusive of but not limited to: extracting bits from an address to index into the cache correctly to determine if there is a hit or miss, allocating data structures and linked lists to implement the structure and engineering of cache memory.
